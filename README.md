## <span style="color:#854710;"> About Me </span>

I’m a Senior Data Engineer with over 8 years of experience working on everything from building scalable data pipelines to managing large distributed systems. I’ve had the chance to work hands-on with tools like PySpark, SQL, AWS, and Snowflake, and I enjoy turning complex data into real business insights. Most of my work has been in the Healthcare and Finance industries, where accuracy and performance really matter. I love collaborating with teams across different functions and always aim to build data solutions that are not just efficient, but also high in quality and governed for the long term.
